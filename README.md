# Apparel-Management-System-BMP

In this repository, you'll find our Business Modeling Project (BMP) focusing on an apparel management system.

Our main aim? To streamline the apparel industry. 

Through this project, we've delved into the world of UML diagrams, understanding their significance in designing efficient systems.
Learning how to draw these diagrams was keyâ€”it's like creating blueprints for smoother operations in the clothing business.

Tools Used :-
